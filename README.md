# Project in Statistics and Data Analysis
## About this project
Laboratory project for a course in statistics and data analysis at KTH

The objective of the project is to predict the winner of a skateboarding competition using data from previous events. Competitors are assigned trick scores and run scores, and based on these, we aim to identify potential advantages beforehand.
